        <h1 class="card-title">BECAUSE MOM LOVES CHOCOLATE, TOO</h1>
        <h6 class="author">ADRIANNA PACHELLI</h6>

        <p class="blogP1">
          Let’s be clear. Nobody cooks better than Mom. Your mom, your SO’s mom,
          your friend’s mom, everyone’s mom is the best cook. It’s best not to
          argue about this, and sometimes it’s best to just let mom be the best.
          Don’t try to one-up her best recipes, don’t try to replicate anything.
          Basically, give up now. Instead, give mom chocolate as the gift worthy
          of her perfect taste and culinary aesthetic. Here’s a few mom-approved
          bars to become the favorite child:
        </p>
        <h5>Amano Raspberry Rose</h5>
        <p class="blogP1">
          This bar hits all the feel good spots Mom will love. Locally made
          (hellloooooo Orem!), artisan, and award-winning are just the
          beginning. Chocolate maker Art Pollard expertly crafts his bars to the
          highest standards. Mix in the crunchy tartness of raspberry and the
          delicate floral finish to rich Ecuadorian chocolate and you have one
          perfect chocolate experience. Don’t believe us? Art’s multitude of
          awards should convince you. Amano has won more awards than any other
          domestic craft chocolate maker, and this bar is an exceptional
          introduction to Amano’s selection of bars.
        </p>
        <h5>Cacao Sampaka Roses & Strawberries</h5>
        <p class="blogP1">
          Are you noticing a trend here? Delicate and floral is so in for craft
          chocolate these days. If Mom isn’t as excited about dark chocolate as
          we are, this is the one for you. Creamy white chocolate envelopes
          crystallized bits of rose and strawberry in a lovely example of
          textural juxtaposition and refined flavor. No soapiness or kool-aid
          artificial raspberry here. Only pure flavors and and swirled yet
          sophisticated mold. What’s more, Mom gets two bars in one of these
          packages. Twice as nice for Mom and one more reason you’re winning at
          this year’s gifting.
