          Chocophiles, meet Luisa Abram, one of the newest chocolate brands
          added to our burgeoning selection of craft chocolate. Luisa Abram is a
          family owned Brazilian chocolate company using beans only from Amazon
          rainforest. The focus is on chocolate from remote, nearly untouched
          areas of the Amazon.
        </p>

          Some of you die hard chocolate fans and Chocolate Society members may
          know about Luisa Abram by now, and maybe have even heard the story
          about the extremes we went through to import this chocolate. But it
          was an ordinary email exchange with Luisa’s father, Andre, that really
          stood out to me that I wanted to share. This snip-it provides
          invaluable insight into Luisa Abram’s brand and ethos as chocolate
          makers.

          “We just came back from a visit to the families that ferment the cocoa
          for our red bars. They are located on the Lower Amazon Basin close to
          the Atlantic. We saw and heard their enthusiasm with our presence and
          more important, our commitment to buy the cocoa they collect in the
          Forest near by. The impact of this relation in their lives is
          palpable, meaningful. We went there to help them produce more beans
          and give feedback about the beans we buy and how to improve them.
          Their main source of income comes from the açaí trade, which is also
          found in the forest close by. Açai is the main crop in the region and
          very few families ferment cocoa, actually only 6 families, the ones we
          deal with.
        </p>

          As for the Jari bars, they come from a community that collect Brazil
          nuts. On their way to the trees, as a side note, they are majestic
          ones really tall and beautiful, they found cocoa trees as well. The
          trip to this origin is a tough one. The Jari river has a lot of
          waterfalls that make the way up very difficult. The situation of this
          origin is very similar to the one I described above. The more the
          locals can get from what the forest has to offer, the better off they
          become and the more protected the Forest will be!!
