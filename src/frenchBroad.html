        <h5 class="author">LUKE HUDMAN</h5>

        <p class="blogP1">
          The Nicaragua bar from French Broad Chocolate was one of the first to
          catch my eye. French Broad bars come in unique light blue packaging,
          reminiscent of a hardback book with gold embossing (it even opens up
          like a book). Inside, youâ€™ll find an introduction to the chocolate
          makers, information about the company, and a small insert detailing
          the origins of the bar and their tasting notes. French Broad also
          offers mini-bars and chocolate chips.

          French Broad Chocolate was founded by partners Jael and Dan Rattigan
          after a journey that took them all the way to Costa Rica on a bus
          fueled by cooking oil. They learned all about chocolate during their
          time in Costa Rica and opened a bakery and chocolate shop. Eventually,
          they found their way to Asheville, North Carolina and founded French
          Broad Chocolate. In 2012, they opened French Broad Chocolate Factory &
          Tasting Room and shifted their focus to single-origin bean-to-bar
          chocolate and broader distribution.

          From the first bite, I was hooked. The bars themselves are a rich,
          dark color and tempered into segmented bars that provide a satisfying
          snap. The chocolate melts smoothly on the tongue and has a creamy
          texture, even without added cacao butter (though some bars do contain
          cacao butter). The flavors of these bars are what really make me love
          them. Each origin is exemplary of its terroir and the flavors are
          expertly coaxed out of the beans.
