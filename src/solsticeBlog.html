        <h1 class="card-title">OUR 4 PICKS FROM SOLSTICE</h1>
        <h6 class="author">BRIAN RUGGLES</h6>

        <p class="blogP1">
          The secret is spreading about how Utah is such a great place for
          chocolate. Truly, it is hard to hide. Between the many makers,
          prevalence of the bars in stores, and sheer numbers of local people
          who devour the greatest chocolate on this blue planet, we have
          something special going on. Now, if our local chocolate makers were a
          bunch of hacks just plodding their way through, who would care? The
          rather pleasant fact that we have some of the VERY BEST chocolate
          makers, each showcasing different takes on the state of American
          chocolate, within an hour of my house makes a chocolate fiend such as
          myself very happy indeed.
        </p>

        <p class="blogP1">
          Solstice is one of these makers who make me proud to share a state
          with them. I met them early in their chocolate-making days, when they
          were making tiny batches for sale at farmers’ markets only. Strangely,
          it was a coworker who first shared it with me, and my first response
          was, “That’s not terrible…” – to which my friend protested at my
          rudeness. But I maintain that the vast majority of chocolate in the
          world is terrible, so that counts as praise from a snob as pretentious
          as me! I met the makers shortly thereafter, and the chocolate had
          improved dramatically. Now we were in “that is really pretty good”
          territory. By the time they launched officially, and on store shelves,
          they had already carved a recognizable niche in the realm of fine
          chocolate.

        <p class="blogP1">
          The style of Solstice is compelling. They bring us these wonderful
          cocoa beans with honest purity. There is no denying nor mistaking the
          connection between the large burlap sacks of cacao that enter the back
          of their shop and the finished bars that proudly bear the name of the
          region that gave them life. But there is so much more substance behind
          their chocolate than merely letting the beans charge through the
          processes uncontested. You see, raw cacao is an INTENSE experience. It
          is not subtle, or quiet, or gentle. It grabs you by the face and
          shakes you. The flavors that eventually find their berth in the bars
          are there, albeit distorted by the loud, astringent, and bitter
          flavors.
        </p>

        <p class="blogP1">
          It takes an artful touch to tame the wild portion, and to elevate and
          accentuate the delicate nuance. Superficially, the chocolate making
          process seems so simple. Roasting, cracking, and various grinding
          and/or aging steps develop the flavors. But that simplicity belies the
          difficulty. Simple does not mean easy. That is why so many chocolate
          makers stumble and fold before they ever unlock the secrets of
          chocolate production. But Solstice has it. Compared to the huge
          industrial makers, their equipment is so cute and dainty. Their
          facility is not one of ageless elegance or architectural beauty. But
          with those basic processes, magic suffuses that space, those
          ingredients. The artistry in producing fine chocolate lies in knowing
          the minute differences between roast levels, grinding times,
          ingredient ratios. Two bars with seemingly identical ingredient lists
          can be so completely different in how the chocolate maker wields her
          tools and weapons and knowledge.

        <p class="blogP1">
          DeAnn Wallin is the lady behind the curtain, and she has developed a
          magical sense of taste and process. The flavors of Solstice bring out
          the best in their beans, and in a typically American style, highlight
          lighter, fresher fruit flavors with a lighter roast than many European
          brands. A light roast can sometimes be a liability if it allows some
          of the off-putting volatile flavors to domineer the experience.
          Somewhere in DeAnn’s methods hides her mysterious prowess to balance
          the bold and the calm. Nowhere will you find a brand that can imitate
          Solstice bar for bar. As one who has attempted making chocolate, I
          don’t get it.
        </p>
        <h5>Madagascar</h5>
        <p class="blogP1">
          Most fine chocolate made with Madagascan beans source from a Swedish
          expat named Bertil Akesson. And so most Madagascan bars start with the
          same raw ingredient. And those beans are Tart – capital T necessary.
          They often smell of balsamic vinegar, grapefruit, and wood. But when
          the chocolate is finished and packaged, Solstice’s stands apart for
          being the (made-up word time) Madagascariest. They preserve so much of
          that vitality and brashness, but it is dialed down to a fun experience
          that doesn’t overstay its welcome. You will find a chocolate that,
          despite being a 70% cacao content bar, is unquestionably “bright.” It
          tastes of lemon and grapefruit, raisins, apple skin, and wood. It has
          a little bitterness, but not like stuffed-shirt poseurs from north of
          France. It has the mild bitterness you associate with fruit skin. It
          is bold and exciting and very eatable. Surprise your friends with this
          one because it is NOTHING like the dark chocolate of my childhood, at
          least.
        </p>

        <h5>Tanzania</h5>

        <p class="blogP1">
          The bar from Tanzania has the high honor of being banned from the Utah
          Chocolate Society’s annual tournament…for winning its first 2 years in
          a row. In order to not simply have a dynasty, we (I) decided to
          disallow it to give other bars a chance. Look for fresh stone fruit
          like peach and apricot, cherry, and yet also honey. And somehow, a
          little bit of mushrooms. For bright and fruity bars, this is probably
          my number one pick.
        </p>

        <h5>Uganda</h5>

        <p class="blogP1">
          Uganda was not a place where people sourced cocoa beans until rather
          recently, but it is not common. This bar blew me away because it is so
          different from other Solstice bars. Rather than being light, bright,
          and fruit-forward, it is deep, dark, and beautiful. It tastes like
          naturally-fermented sourdough bread and cinnamon. While the beans
          roast, it smells like banana bread. Look for green banana and even a
          little mango hiding in the background. And if you can find (or make!)
          brownies with it, buckle up!
